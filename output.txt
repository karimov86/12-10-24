Avywenna Review
Endgame ReviewAvywenna stands as the sole Arknights: Endfield character using a Polearm in battle. Serving as a Specialist role, 
she facilitates consistent elemental fusions for her party through her Ultimate ability. When utilizing Avywenna’s Battle Skill, 
exercise caution as it may disrupt enemy formations by pushing them back; avoid pushing foes out of areas targeted by ongoing skills. 
Conversely, her Ultimate enables a continuous stagger effect on enemies, triggering elemental fusions each time a skill is directed 
towards it. Aim to deploy her Ultimate in close proximity to maximize impact on multiple adversaries.

special bottle with him wherever he goes. It doesn’t look like anything special to most people, but anyone familiar with the writing 
of Yan would wonder about its origins. However, if that person happens to be from Hongshan, they would immediately recognize its origins 
and significance, because they know very well that the bottle is an item of honor only awarded to “major contributors to science”.
